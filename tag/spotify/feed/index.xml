<p>Kendrick Lamar&#8217;s new album To Pimp A Butterfly has broken global streaming records on Spotify.</p>
<p>The album, which was unexpectedly released early this week (March 16), was streamed more than 9.6 million times on the service on its first day, setting a new record.</p>
<p>The previous record holder for the highest number of global streams in a single day was Michael Buble&#8217;s Christmas, which notched up 9.5 million streams on Christmas Eve 2014.</p>
<p>To Pimp A Butterfly, which includes the Top 20 hit I, was originally slated for release on March 23. The album was then seemingly released in error on Monday after a representative for the rapper tweeted it was put by &#8220;mistake&#8221;.</p>
<p>The record marks Lamar&#8217;s second LP after 2012&#8217;s Good Kid M.A.A.D City, which peaked at Number 16 on the Official Albums Chart.</p>
