										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Track your activities and monitor your health with the best smartwatch. This wristwatch-slash-miniature companion to your smartphone is a useful tool especially if you&#8217;re trying to lead a healthy, active lifestyle or you&#8217;re on a wellness path. The more advanced models can even assist you in keeping an eye on some health concerns.</p>
<p>Finding the absolute best smartwatch for you is vital. Not only are there many on the market, but their features and functionalities – as well as size, shape, and <a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-phone" data-component-tracked="1">smartphone</a> compatibility – differ as well. And, you don&#8217;t want to end up with one that won&#8217;t meet your demands or pay a lot more for one that&#8217;s a bit of an overkill for your minimal needs.</p>

<p>We at TechRadar have tested and reviewed most smartwatch releases out there, from the more prevalent <a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-apple-watch" data-component-tracked="1">Apple Watches</a> and older <a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-samsung-smartwatch-finding-the-right-tizen-wearable-for-you" data-component-tracked="1">Samsung smartwatches</a> to Fitbit&#8217;s offerings and <a class="hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-wear-os-watch" data-component-tracked="1">Wear OS watches</a> from brands like Fossil and Mobvoi. And, we&#8217;re here to guide you in choosing the most ideal smartwatch for you by gathering the best we&#8217;ve tested and ranking them here according to budget, use, and features.</p>
<p>For each entry though we&#8217;ve included a full specs list, along with an overview from our review and the key good and bad points. We&#8217;ve also included our price comparison tool so that you grab the best price available on the smartwatch you want.
