<p>Germany’s opposition parties backed on <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/politics/german-opposition-backs-anti-austerity-protest/en/world/480190--germany-clashes-as-thousands-rally-against-austerity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thursday a major anti-austerity rally organized by the pan-European Blockupy</a> movement in Frankfurt on Wednesday and criticized the German government for its attempts to discredit the protest.</p>
<p>The main opposition Left Party’s co-chair, Katja Kipping, said that more than 20,000 demonstrators peacefully protested the EU’s austerity measures and the inauguration of the new €1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>“The overwhelming majority of people who took to the streets in Frankfurt yesterday wanted to demonstrate decisively but also peacefully against the austerity measures and they wanted to demonstrate that another Europe was possible,” Kipping said Thursday at a special session of the German parliament, which was scheduled to discuss the events of yesterday.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters were arrested and scores of police officers injured in Frankfurt on Wednesday after clashes that broke out in the early hours of the protests.</p>
<p>Some protesters set up barricades on the streets while others set fire to police cars during the clashes.  Organizers blamed the police for provoking violence.</p>
<p>Kipping distanced herself from the groups that used violence and underlined that these were a minority.</p>
<p>She dismissed government claims that the organizers planned the violent actions in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Kipping said that the organizers of the protest clearly denounced violence and also worked to defuse tensions during the day.</p>
<p>“The aim of the protests was to clearly demonstrate to the European Central Bank that the opening of such a new, luxury headquarters could only be a source of protest, not celebration,” Kipping stressed.</p>
<p>Opposition Green Party lawmaker Irene Mihalic criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democrat bloc for blaming all the demonstrators for the violence and not differentiating between peaceful protestors and small, violent groups.</p>
<p>“Now you are trying to discredit the whole protest movement which also includes members of trade unions and democratic parties. You argue that they are all activists who are ready to use violence, who are abusing the right to protest. Then how can you explain the peaceful demonstration of thousands of people in the afternoon in Frankfurt’s city center,” Mihalic said at the parliament.</p>
<p>She also called on the Blockupy movement to clearly distance itself from any group that views the use of violence as legitimate.</p>
<p>Germany’s interior minister Thomas de Maiziere blamed the organizers on Thursday for the clashes in Frankfurt, claiming that these groups planned the violent actions weeks before.</p>
<p>“One who behaves in this manner and abuses freedoms and rights clearly crosses borders that we as a state of the rule of law cannot tolerate,” de Maiziere told lawmakers in parliament.</p>
<p>De Maiziere said 150 police officers were injured during the protests, 55 police cars were damaged and seven others were set on fire.</p>
<p>The pan-European Blockupy movement, an alliance of around 90 anti-globalization and anti-racist political parties, said that more than 200 protestors were injured during the clashes. The movement claimed police provoked protesters through their use of heavy security measures and deliberate use of tear gas.</p>
<p>The movement includes activist groups such as Attac, which advocates the taxing of financial transactions, Verdi, Germany&#8217;s second-biggest union which has more than two million members, and German political party Die Linke (The Left), which currently holds more than 10 percent of the country&#8217;s parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>Greek leftist party Syriza, which was elected in January, is also a member of the movement which argues ECB policies are pushing for balanced budgets at the expense of poor people and the middle classes across Europe.</p>
<p>Blockupy highlights the harsh economic measures imposed on heavily indebted Greece since 2010 by the &#8220;troika,&#8221; which is comprised of the ECB, European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, as an example of unacceptable and destructive economic practices.</p>

<p>Tbilisi described the &#8220;alliance and integration&#8221; treaty as a &#8220;move aimed at annexation&#8221; and the United States and European Union said they would not recognize the agreement, which the EU depicted as a threat to regional security and stability.</p>
<p>Under the deal, signed in the Kremlin by Putin and South Ossetian leader Leonid Tibilov, a former KGB official, the region&#8217;s security forces, military, economy, customs service and border guards will be deeply integrated with those of <span class="highlight">Russia</span>.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Russia</span>&#8216;s new treaty with Georgia&#8217;s breakaway South Ossetia region breaks international law and hampers efforts to strengthen regional security, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This so-called treaty is yet another move by the Russian Federation that hampers ongoing efforts by the international community to strengthen security and stability in the region,&#8221; Stoltenberg said in a statement, adding that NATO did not recognize the treaty.</p>

<p>Stoltenberg said the agreement &#8220;violates Georgia&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and blatantly contradicts the principles of international law, OSCE principles and <span class="highlight">Russia</span>&#8216;s international commitments.</p>
<p>In accordance with NATO, the US does not recognize the legitimacy of the treaty signed as well. &#8220;The occupied regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are integral parts of Georgia, and we continue to support Georgia&#8217;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,&#8221; US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another step is being taken today to strengthen our partnership,&#8221; Putin said after signing what he described as a &#8220;landmark&#8221; treaty in the Kremlin, with the Russian and South Ossetian flags behind him.</p>
<p>Tibilov hailed the agreement, which will make it easier for the people of South Ossetia to gain Russian citizenship, as &#8220;the best possible guarantee of state security&#8221;. He said EU and U.S. officials should mind their own business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="EG5OqA">The FBI announced Friday it was <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-re-open-investigation-clinton-email-server-n674631" target="new" rel="noopener">renewing their investigation</a> into Hillary Clinton&#8217;s use of private email servers, after deciding not to press charges in September after their first round of investigation. For months, the &#8220;email scandal&#8221; has haunted Clinton&#8217;s campaign, and conservatives have used it to feed into a larger message: that Clinton can&#8217;t be trusted.</p>
<p id="lPbFi2">Just look at all the stories Breitbart puts under the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tag/hillary-clinton-email-scandal/">&#8220;</a><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tag/hillary-clinton-email-scandal/">Hillary Clinton Email Scandal</a><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tag/hillary-clinton-email-scandal/">&#8220;</a> tag. It&#8217;s a mishmash of stories — including ones about her hiding health problems, which have nothing to do with email. All the articles together weave a storyline that seems more egregious than the individual parts that make it up.</p>
<p id="bPY0pP">But at the core of it, there really are problems. And we should be able to talk about those problems with clarity. <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/9/13/12770636/hillary-clinton-email-scandals-explained">Vox&#8217;s Jeff Stein created a concise framework</a> about the scandal, so we made a cartoon that pinpoints the primary issues at play.</p>
<h3 id="lWp9mQ">First, let&#8217;s walk through what actually happened</h3>
<p id="Y8YJ3W">To understand what exactly it was that Clinton did, we need to understand what an email server is. It’s the technical underpinning of the controversy.</p>
<p id="iH0WX8">It’s basically like a post office. It&#8217;s a computer connected to the internet that sorts through letters and delivers them.</p>

<p id="aSDAmg">So that means the person in charge of this digital post office — a postmaster, if you will — has an important job. This person has to implement security features to make sure the server can do its job well. This person also has control of the messages coming in and out.</p>
<p id="M3wIMv">Normally for the secretary of state, this responsibility would&#8217;ve belonged to people in federal government who have the expertise to maintain email systems.</p>

<p id="YKSSNI">Clinton&#8217;s private server had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-gregg/six-ways-hillary-clintons_b_8071822.html">several potential points of vulnerability</a>, so it was possible for spies to hack into the system — both to view messages or to reroute messages.</p>
<p id="6dH7VM">There was no evidence that Clinton&#8217;s server was breached, but hackers are good at covering their tracks, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-no-evidence-clintons-email-was-hacked-by-foreign-powers-but-it-could-have-been/2016/07/05/93334ba0-42dc-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html">FBI hints that it thinks </a>a hack was likely.</p>
<p id="R0PZDx">On her servers, an FBI investigation in July 2016 found <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-01-of-02/view">81 email chains</a> that ranged from confidential to top secret, but intelligence agencies overuse these labels, so it&#8217;s unclear if revealing these emails would&#8217;ve actually threatened national security.</p>
<p id="SXmVQO">There was <a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/negligence-and-gross-negligence/">&#8220;</a><a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/negligence-and-gross-negligence/">gross negligence</a><a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/negligence-and-gross-negligence/">,&#8221; as the </a><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/07/05/the-clinton-email-probe-and-the-question-of-gross-negligence/" target="new" rel="noopener">FBI points out</a>.</p>
<p id="GIwFhQ">Eventually, Clinton&#8217;s staff hired a private company to run their email servers in Secaucus, New Jersey. This was a more secure option, but still not ideal. In fact, if we&#8217;re talking about pure security, it&#8217;s unclear what the best option would&#8217;ve been.</p>

<p id="YmWBbj">Email servers are physical computers — and the person who controls those servers has your data.</p>
<p id="vU1voW">When Congress was investigating the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, it asked the State Department for Clinton&#8217;s emails. But the department <a href="http://benghazi.house.gov/sites/republicans.benghazi.house.gov/files/Interim%20Progress%20Update%2005-08-15.pdf">only turned over eight emails</a>. That&#8217;s because Clinton&#8217;s emails were on her own server, not theirs.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">That said, Republicans have insisted Clinton did this to avoid having her emails released or subject to the Freedom of Information Act. In other words, the accusation is that she did it so the public couldn’t see her communication. This goes to motive, which means it&#8217;s difficult to prove either way, and anyone who claims otherwise is speculating.</span></div>

<p id="w7JgnW">But the idea that she is actively trying to hide her communication feeds into a more absurd accusation that we should dismiss: that Clinton tried to delete emails from her server during the House&#8217;s Benghazi investigation.

<p id="x7rRmc">There is another completely separate case that has to do with emails but gets thrown into the &#8220;Clinton email scandal&#8221; bin as well. The right-wing transparency group Judicial Watch obtained emails between top officials at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p id="65sxMH">Some think it shows that people who donated to the Clinton Foundation received preference from the secretary of state&#8217;s office. There is no evidence to back this up, and this storyline has nothing to do with her private server. It&#8217;s another story, like the one about her health, that is woven into the larger narrative that Clinton can&#8217;t be trusted.</p>
<h3 id="UEhvQX">What we should actually take away from this</h3>
<p id="BKip1S">There are two primary problems with Clinton&#8217;s decision to use a private email server.</p>
<p id="Jaz3Oi">The first is cybersecurity. The FBI concluded that Clinton and her staff were not fully aware of the threat they exposed themselves to. It points to a larger problem with government, where public servants outside the intelligence agencies often treat cybersecurity as an afterthought. Last year, Congress did <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754">pass a law</a> that allows private companies to work with government to improve cybersecurity, and this year President Barack Obama created a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-obama-idUSKCN0VQ2BZ">commission on cyber defense</a>. But there are still massive <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2016/0914/Opinion-How-the-next-president-can-get-cybersecurity-right">political</a> and <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/02/president_obama_s_cybersecurity_plan_is_ambitious_but_flawed.html">bureaucratic</a> problems that the next executive has to deal with.</p>
<p id="02UUU6">The second issue is transparency. The Obama administration has been among the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-least-transparent-administration-1433287361">&#8220;</a><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-least-transparent-administration-1433287361">least transparent</a><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-least-transparent-administration-1433287361">&#8220;</a> in recent history, even though Obama promised greater transparency during his 2008 campaign. The administration has kept entire <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/the-obama-administrations-abject-failure-on-transparency/252387/">government programs secret</a>, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-least-transparent-administration-1433287361">stonewalled public records requests</a>, and viciously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-obamas-war-on-leaks-reporters-fight-back/2013/10/04/70231e1c-2aeb-11e3-b139-029811dbb57f_story.html?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.6d163cdd427e">gone after those who leak information</a>.</p>
<p id="cf8Lut">An Associated Press investigation found that the backlog of public records requests <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/obama-administration-sets-new-record-withholding-foia-requests/">grew 55 percent</a> under Obama. So whatever Clinton&#8217;s motive was for the private server, it brings up concerns about whether the public&#8217;s right to know will continue to erode under the next administration. And Donald Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/donald-trump-taxes/">hasn&#8217;t exactly been the model</a> for transparency either, though he has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/arts/television/on-dr-oz-trump-offers-placebo-transparency.html?_r=0">tried to create the illusion of it</a>.</p>
<p id="2UFjXv">Both of these are massive, nuanced issues that raise real questions about how Clinton or Trump would govern. It touches on two increasingly relevant issues about our data — how we should protect it, and who should be able to see it. But they’ve been reframed into this amorphous narrative about trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Obama administration is investigating allegations that two senior Secret Service agents, including a top member of the president’s protective detail, drove a government car into White House security barricades after drinking at a late-night party last week, an agency official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officers on duty who witnessed the March 4 incident wanted to arrest the agents and conduct sobriety tests, according to a current and a former government official familiar with the incident. But the officers were ordered by a supervisor on duty that night to let the agents go home, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal matter.</p>
<p>The episode presents an early test for the Secret Service’s new director, Joseph P. Clancy, who was <a title="www.washingtonpost.com" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bucking-advice-obama-considers-secret-service-insider-as-new-director/2015/02/12/b1be73da-b2c1-11e4-886b-c22184f27c35_story.html">appointed by Obama last month</a> after a string of security lapses at the White House and other embarrassing missteps and had vowed to restore the agency’s once-stellar reputation.</p>
<p>Clancy on Monday directed that the inquiry be led by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general, in part because the incident involves such senior officials, a law enforcement official said.</p>
<p>Agency spokesman Brian Leary confirmed the investigation after questions from The Washington Post, saying the Secret Service was “aware of the allegations of misconduct involving two of our employees.” He declined to specify which allegations are the focus of the inquiry.</p>
<p>“If misconduct is identified, appropriate action will be taken based on established rules and regulations,” Leary said. He added that the agency “will fully cooperate” with the inspector general’s office.</p>
<p>The incident drew a bipartisan rebuke late Wednesday from two lawmakers leading an investigation into the Secret Service, who said it cast doubt on whether enough has changed at the troubled agency.</p>
<div class="grey-bg">
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/701/wpni.politics_5__container__"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">“Although recent steps have been made to bring new leadership in at the highest levels, this incident begs the question of whether that is enough,” Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman and the ranking Democrat of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in a joint statement. “The fact that this event involved senior-level agents is not only embarrassing but exhibits a clear lack of judgment in a potentially dangerous situation.”</span></div>
</div>
<p>An administration official said that in “recent days,” the White House had been “made aware of the allegations and the steps being taken by the Secret Service to ensure that the incident is thoroughly investigated.”</p>
<p>The agents under investigation are Mark Connolly, the second-in-command on Obama’s detail, and George Ogilvie, a senior supervisor in the Washington field office.</p>
<p>Through the Secret Service spokesman, Connolly and Ogilvie declined to comment.</p>
<p>An agency official said the two employees had been moved to “non-supervisory, non-operational assignments.” They were not put on administrative leave, which has been a typical procedure when agents are under investigation for alleged misconduct.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The incident happened about 10:30 p.m. on the White House compound near 15th Street NW and Freedom Plaza, as D.C. police officers and Secret Service officers were trying to clear the scene because of an investigation of a suspicious package, according to the people familiar with the incident.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported that the car’s overhead flashing lights had been activated and both agents were showing their badges to get through the section of the grounds that had been closed off, according to people familiar with the incident.</p>
<p>The vehicle ran through security tape before hitting the barricades, which an agency official said had been set up temporarily during the investigation of the package.</p>
<p>Secret Service rules prohibit turning on flashing lights without a security reason and driving a government vehicle after drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>The two men had been attending a party at a nearby downtown Washington bar to honor the retirement of departing Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan.</p>
<p>Two people familiar with the incident said it was probably captured on Secret Service video. They said all of the agents’ activities on that part of the compound would have likely been streamed live to the agency’s emergency command center.</p>
<p>The incident violated security protocols, according to several veteran agents. At the time that the agents allegedly drove into the barricade, disrupting an active investigation, officers had not yet determined whether the suspicious package was a threat.</p>
<p>If a civilian drives through a White House security barrier, officers are trained to release an attack dog or point loaded guns at the driver.</p>
<p>In October 2013, a Connecticut <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/officers-who-shot-woman-in-chase-that-ended-near-us-capitol-will-not-be-charged/2014/07/10/b46c1c2c-0858-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html">woman was shot and killed </a>by police after she rammed a temporary security barrier outside the White House with her car and led police on a chase that ended with both Capitol Police and Secret Service officers firing multiple rounds and killing her. Her 1-year-old child was inside the car but was not hurt.</p>
<p>Last week’s incident is the first major misstep to take place since the management shake-up that began last October, when <a title="www.washingtonpost.com" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/julia-pierson-resigns-as-secret-service-director/2014/10/01/ea39a396-499f-11e4-891d-713f052086a0_story.html">Julia Pierson abruptly resigned</a> as director in the weeks after a man was able to jump the White House fence and race through much of the mansion’s main floor.</p>
<p>Clancy took over as acting director, moving later to force out much of the senior management team.</p>
<div class="grey-bg">
<div id="google_ads_iframe_/701/wpni.politics_11__container__"><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">An independent panel created by the Department of Homeland Security to examine the Secret Service’s problems strongly recommended late last year that the president choose an outsider as the new director. The panel said the agency was “starved for leadership” with fresh perspectives.</span></div>
</div>
<p>But Obama went with a trusted hand, picking Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the agency who had headed Obama’s security detail early in his administration and who had also worked with Connolly.</p>

<p>Starting this October, veterinarians licensed in Nevada can recommend and administer hemp and cannabidiol products containing not more than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol without fear of sanction from the state licensing board.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Gov. Steve Sisolak signed Assembly Bill 101, making Nevada the first state to legalize the use of cannabinoids as a veterinary treatment. The Nevada Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners helped write AB 101, which the Nevada VMA supported, according to NVMA Executive Director Michelle Wagner.</p>
<p>The bill’s sponsor, State Assemblyman Steve Yeager, introduced the measure in February because Nevada law was unclear about whether veterinarians were permitted to administer CBD products or discuss them with pet owners.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="align-center" src="https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/2021-10-01-feature-01a.jpg" alt="Marijuana plant" width="760" height="506" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="270b99a4-87e5-4aa0-bcad-c1bba35fe688" /><br />
“Because of the ambiguity in our law, I learned that many veterinarians chose not to talk about CBD with pet owners for fear of being disciplined,” Yeager said. “This left pet owners in a tough spot because CBD products are generally unregulated, and it would be difficult for a pet owner to know exactly what to purchase or administer without the professional advice of a veterinarian.”</p>
<p>Nevada voters approved medical marijuana for people by ballot initiative in 2000. Cannabis became legal for recreational use in the state on Jan. 1, 2017, following a 2016 ballot measure.</p>
<p>AB 101 encountered no opposition and passed the state Assembly and Senate without a single no vote, Yeager explained.</p>
<p>“I certainly hope that other states follow Nevada’s lead and provide reassurances to licensed veterinarians that they can administer CBD or talk about it with patients without fear of facing disciplinary proceedings,” he said. “The bill itself is fairly simple and, thus, is a good model for other states.”</p>
<p>Although products containing 0.3% or less THC are exempted from the federal Controlled Substances Act, the products do fall under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if they are used therapeutically or included in animal food. The Food and Drug Administration considers the therapeutic use of these products to be the use of unapproved drugs.</p>
<h3><span class="h3">A simple question</span></h3>
<p>But do medical cannabinoids actually help animal patients?</p>
<p>It’s a deceptively simple question at the heart of an animal health concern complicated by a tangle of federal and state regulations, research challenges, and species-specific pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p>Dr. Dawn Boothe is a professor of veterinary physiology and pharmacology at Auburn University studying cannabis’s potential as a veterinary treatment. She sought to make sense of the issues during her presentation “Medical Cannabinoids Revisited” at AVMA Virtual Convention 2021 on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>The cannabis sativa plant contains more than 90 unique compounds, or cannabinoids, including CBD and THC, as well as almost 500 other terpenoids and phenylpropanoids. For several millennia, humans have used cannabinoids for pain, epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders, and even infections.</p>
<p>Dr. Boothe said research interest in the therapeutic use of cannabis in the United States essentially came to a “screeching halt” in 1971 with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which listed cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning the federal government regarded cannabis as having no therapeutic properties and a high potential for abuse.</p>
<p>“That’s changed in the last couple of decades as, increasingly, states are paying attention to medical cannabinoids,” Dr. Boothe said. “But I do shudder to think sometimes about how much we would have learned if we had taken a different path in our reaction to cannabis.”</p>
<p>The federal government’s position on cannabis has somewhat softened in recent years, most notably with the 2018 Farm Bill’s removal of industrial hemp containing 0.3% or less of THC from the Controlled Substances Act. That said, the use, sale, and possession of cannabis over 0.3% THC, despite laws in many states permitting it under various circumstances, is illegal under federal law.</p>
<h3><span class="h3">Making sense of it all</span></h3>
<p>The restrictions on veterinarians haven’t diminished interest among pet owners, who have available to them a veritable pharmacopeia of CBD products claiming to treat any number of animal ailments and behavioral problems.</p>
<p>None of the products are approved by the FDA, which, as Dr. Boothe explained, raises concerns about variability in cannabinoid concentrations, mislabeling, and contamination with harmful additives, such as fentanyl or synthetic cannabinoids.</p>
<p>“If you’re looking for a product that has a certificate of analysis that you can have faith in—as I would—go to the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) website and look at the laboratories that the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) has approved as being appropriate for analysis of hemp crops,” Dr. Boothe said. “That at least can increase the level of validity for that product.”</p>
<p>Then there are questions about what constitutes a therapeutic dose of cannabinoid in a particular species as well as which formulations actually deliver that dose to the animal patient. There’s evidence that, in dogs, the route of CBD administration, such as in a soft capsule containing oil, may increase the oral bioavailability, according to Dr. Boothe.</p>
<p>“Hemp seed oil, sesame seed oil, and medium-chain triglycerides are the most common oils that are being used,” she said. “We need to see data demonstrating the differences in oral bioavailability among these different compounds.”</p>
<p>Cats are more challenging. “We’re going to have to have some good pharmacokinetic studies providing us information about dosing and cats,” Dr. Boothe said. “We have demonstrated that in cats there is variability in absorption, but, as in dogs, feeding will enhance that absorption.”</p>
<p>Dogs appear to tolerate CBD far better than THC, which was shown to cause ataxia when administered intravenously in smaller, less-concentrated doses than CBD. Dogs were also found to build a tolerance to cannabinoids over time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="align-center" src="https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/2021-10-01-feature-01b.jpg" alt="Veterinarian giving CBD oil drops to a cat" width="760" height="355" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="f644e7a8-9baa-4f16-9548-a9762622e5f1" /><br />
“My comfort zone with CBD is much greater than with THC,” Dr. Boothe said. She highlighted a Veterinary Clinics of North America report on marijuana toxicology that showed patients that had received CBD were much more likely to be asymptomatic than those patients that received a synthetic cannabinoid or THC.</p>
<p>“In fact, fatality in pets from marijuana is probably more likely due to receiving a medical-grade chocolate or probably a synthetic cannabinoid, not a phytocannabinoid,” or cannabinoid that occurs naturally in the cannabis plant, she explained.</p>
<p>A small yet growing body of research indicates that CBD is a safe and effective treatment for lameness and epilepsy in dogs, Dr. Boothe said, but more studies are needed to bear this out.</p>
<p>“I am excited about CBD,” she said. “I think it’s a very safe compound. I think it’s claim to fame is going to be largely in combination with our traditional therapies—if the indication or if the disease is very mild, maybe sole therapy, but as the disease progresses, adjuvant therapy is going to be important.</p>
<p>“And I do think that therapeutic drug monitoring should be an important tool to make sure that therapeutic concentrations have been achieved.”</p>
