										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar, has been voted the Best Airport in the World at the Skytrax 2021 World Airport Awards, ending Singapore Changi Airport’s eight-year reign at the top.</p>
<p>This year, the World Airport Awards have recognized the efforts of global airports in adapting and meeting the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the past 18 months officially recognized as the most financially difficult period on record.</p>

<p>Airports across the globe have invested to provide the safest possible environment for their customers and staff during the pandemic, although events have impacted some regions and airports more than others, with many areas having few, if any, international routes operating for more than a year.</p>
<p>Badr Mohammed Al-Meer, chief operating officer at Hamad International Airport (HIA), said, “This is not only a truly remarkable achievement for HIA and the state of Qatar, but an endorsement from our travelers for our commitment to service excellence. HIA continues to serve as a global benchmark for airports around the world, thanks to the dedication and collaboration of our team and stakeholders. To this day, HIA’s crisis preparedness, business continuity strategy, and agile and effective response to the Covid-19 pandemic continue to be recognized by leading industry institutions. As we look toward the future, HIA remains devoted to boosting our efforts in providing the best airport experience to all our passengers.”</p>
<p>Hamad International rounded off its success at the 2021 World Airport Awards by winning the awards for the Best Airport in the Middle East, the World’s Best Airport in the 25 to 35 million Passenger category, and for the Best Airport Staff in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Edward Plaisted, CEO of Skytrax, said, “We are delighted to announce that HIA has been voted the World’s Best Airport 2021. Inaugurated in 2014, Hamad International Airport has rapidly become a customer favorite and moved from No. 3 in the world in 2020 to be ranked World’s Best Airport this year. Achieving this honor is very much a team effort, and our congratulations go to the management, staff and stakeholders at Hamad International Airport that help make this happen. As travel hubs worldwide have been impacted by the pandemic, Hamad International Airport was undeterred by the global travel disruptions and continued with its expansion plans while introducing additional airport health and safety standards. As it is the Official Airport Partner for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, we wish Hamad International Airport every success in helping to host such a major event.”</p>

<p>Germany’s opposition parties backed on <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/politics/german-opposition-backs-anti-austerity-protest/en/world/480190--germany-clashes-as-thousands-rally-against-austerity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thursday a major anti-austerity rally organized by the pan-European Blockupy</a> movement in Frankfurt on Wednesday and criticized the German government for its attempts to discredit the protest.</p>
<p>The main opposition Left Party’s co-chair, Katja Kipping, said that more than 20,000 demonstrators peacefully protested the EU’s austerity measures and the inauguration of the new €1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>“The overwhelming majority of people who took to the streets in Frankfurt yesterday wanted to demonstrate decisively but also peacefully against the austerity measures and they wanted to demonstrate that another Europe was possible,” Kipping said Thursday at a special session of the German parliament, which was scheduled to discuss the events of yesterday.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters were arrested and scores of police officers injured in Frankfurt on Wednesday after clashes that broke out in the early hours of the protests.</p>
<p>Some protesters set up barricades on the streets while others set fire to police cars during the clashes.  Organizers blamed the police for provoking violence.</p>
<p>Kipping distanced herself from the groups that used violence and underlined that these were a minority.</p>
<p>She dismissed government claims that the organizers planned the violent actions in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Kipping said that the organizers of the protest clearly denounced violence and also worked to defuse tensions during the day.</p>
<p>“The aim of the protests was to clearly demonstrate to the European Central Bank that the opening of such a new, luxury headquarters could only be a source of protest, not celebration,” Kipping stressed.</p>
<p>Opposition Green Party lawmaker Irene Mihalic criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling Christian Democrat bloc for blaming all the demonstrators for the violence and not differentiating between peaceful protestors and small, violent groups.</p>
<p>“Now you are trying to discredit the whole protest movement which also includes members of trade unions and democratic parties. You argue that they are all activists who are ready to use violence, who are abusing the right to protest. Then how can you explain the peaceful demonstration of thousands of people in the afternoon in Frankfurt’s city center,” Mihalic said at the parliament.</p>
<p>She also called on the Blockupy movement to clearly distance itself from any group that views the use of violence as legitimate.</p>
<p>Germany’s interior minister Thomas de Maiziere blamed the organizers on Thursday for the clashes in Frankfurt, claiming that these groups planned the violent actions weeks before.</p>
<p>“One who behaves in this manner and abuses freedoms and rights clearly crosses borders that we as a state of the rule of law cannot tolerate,” de Maiziere told lawmakers in parliament.</p>
<p>De Maiziere said 150 police officers were injured during the protests, 55 police cars were damaged and seven others were set on fire.</p>
<p>The pan-European Blockupy movement, an alliance of around 90 anti-globalization and anti-racist political parties, said that more than 200 protestors were injured during the clashes. The movement claimed police provoked protesters through their use of heavy security measures and deliberate use of tear gas.</p>
<p>The movement includes activist groups such as Attac, which advocates the taxing of financial transactions, Verdi, Germany&#8217;s second-biggest union which has more than two million members, and German political party Die Linke (The Left), which currently holds more than 10 percent of the country&#8217;s parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>Greek leftist party Syriza, which was elected in January, is also a member of the movement which argues ECB policies are pushing for balanced budgets at the expense of poor people and the middle classes across Europe.</p>
<p>Blockupy highlights the harsh economic measures imposed on heavily indebted Greece since 2010 by the &#8220;troika,&#8221; which is comprised of the ECB, European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, as an example of unacceptable and destructive economic practices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="speakable">Ryanair, known mostly for its risqué ads and abysmal customer service, has announced it plans to expand to the U.S.</p>
<p class="speakable">The budget airline, which primarily operates throughout Western Europe, is trying to capture a slice of the hugely profitable transatlantic market dominated by legacy carriers.</p>
<p>“The board of Ryanair, like any PLC, have approved the business plans for future growth, including transatlantic. We are talking to manufacturers about long-haul aircraft but can’t comment further on this,” a spokesperson for the airline told <a href="http://skift.com/2015/03/17/thus-the-fight-begins-ryanair-is-coming-to-the-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skift.</a> “European consumers want lower cost travel to the USA and the same for Americans coming to Europe. We see it as a logical development in the European market.”</p>
<p>Ryanair said it would offer promotional fares—as low as £10 or $15 —from select American cities to London to shake up the old guard.  But don&#8217;t get too excited.  Regular prices would run about $200 to $300, and then there are the slew of fees, including charges to reserve seats and airline ticket printing.</p>
<p>The airline plans to offer flights between as many as 14 European cities and 12 to 14 U.S. cities. While the plan is still in its infant stages, we could see Ryanair stateside in about five years.</p>
<p>According to IATA data, the transatlantic market is considered the “jewel of the aviation industry,” accounting for over 16 percent of global airline traffic and a whopping 55 percent of revenue.  Despite an open-skies deal signed between the European Union and the U.S. in 2007, budget carriers have not figured out a model that allows them to compete.</p>
<p>But flying across Europe, with its notoriously cramped seats and scaled down amenities, may not be like flying across the pond.</p>
<p>The carrier plans to buy a fleet of 50 brand new aircraft that will feature a business class section, which doesn&#8217;t exist on its European service.  These could include fuel-efficient, modern planes, such as the Boeing Dreamliner and Airbus A350, but it all depends on when the carrier could get them, because manufacturing demand for these aircraft has soared.</p>
<p>But, Ryanair may be dependent on the use of second-tier airports—usually miles away from the major city hubs—which allows for greater airline efficiency and helps significantly cut costs.  U.S. airline consolidation has reduced capacity at these smaller markets, but customers, especially business travelers, may see these locations as less desirable.</p>

<p>Under the deal, signed in the Kremlin by Putin and South Ossetian leader Leonid Tibilov, a former KGB official, the region&#8217;s security forces, military, economy, customs service and border guards will be deeply integrated with those of <span class="highlight">Russia</span>.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Russia</span>&#8216;s new treaty with Georgia&#8217;s breakaway South Ossetia region breaks international law and hampers efforts to strengthen regional security, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This so-called treaty is yet another move by the Russian Federation that hampers ongoing efforts by the international community to strengthen security and stability in the region,&#8221; Stoltenberg said in a statement, adding that NATO did not recognize the treaty.</p>

<p>Stoltenberg said the agreement &#8220;violates Georgia&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and blatantly contradicts the principles of international law, OSCE principles and <span class="highlight">Russia</span>&#8216;s international commitments.</p>
<p>In accordance with NATO, the US does not recognize the legitimacy of the treaty signed as well. &#8220;The occupied regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are integral parts of Georgia, and we continue to support Georgia&#8217;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,&#8221; US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another step is being taken today to strengthen our partnership,&#8221; Putin said after signing what he described as a &#8220;landmark&#8221; treaty in the Kremlin, with the Russian and South Ossetian flags behind him.</p>
<p>Tibilov hailed the agreement, which will make it easier for the people of South Ossetia to gain Russian citizenship, as &#8220;the best possible guarantee of state security&#8221;. He said EU and U.S. officials should mind their own business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yahoo wants to end your dependency on memorizing passwords — or creating crap ones that can be guessed or hacked — after it <a href="http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/113708272894/a-new-simple-way-to-log-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a new “on-demand” system that sends a one-time password when you need to log in.</p>
<p>The new approach is designed to increase security and make your Yahoo account less hackable. In some ways it achieves that. Countless millions of people recycle memorable passwords across a number of services, including their email account. Not only are they usually fairly hackable in nature (<a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/01/20/this-list-of-2014s-worst-passwords-including-123456-is-embarrassing/">randomized passwords are preferred</a>), but they’re inherently insecure because, if/when cracked, they open large parts of your digital identity, or your <em>entire</em> online presence.</p>
<p>On-demand passwords, which are not usable after you’ve logged in, are designed to remove that password-chain/ potential domino effect because they are specific to your Yahoo account. But, there’s one fairly major caveat: if you lose your phone, the person in possession of it has a ticket into your email.</p>
<p>In some cases, if you get SMS notifications on your lock-screen, the on-demand password will show up even if your phone is locked. So, if you lose it, the person who picks it up doesn’t even need to know your passcode to get into your Yahoo account once they know your ID.</p>
<p>A better approach might be two-step passwords, whereby after entering your main password, you are then set a temporary password via SMS. That’s the basic if two-factor authentication. <a href="http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/yahoo-wants-to-let-you-forget-your-yahoo-password/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo told CNET </a>that this is “the first step to eliminating passwords,” so we <del>hope</del> expect that there’s more to come on that front.</p>
<p>Yahoo is right to focus on mobile security, it’s an area where the average internet user is chronically unaware of best practices. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/a/anatomy-of-a-hack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Even those who are more savvy get caught out</a>. The best approach remains a password manager, such as 1Password or LastPass, and an awareness of the risks.</p>
<p>In related news, the company also showed an early glimpse of <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2014/08/07/yahoo-to-strengthen-email-encryption/">its end-to-end email encryption plug-in</a>, which <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2014/12/17/googles-end-to-end-email-encryption-tool-gets-closer-to-launch/">it is working on in conjunction with Google</a>, at South-By-Southwest.</p>
<p>The video below — <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/15/8219529/yahoo-on-demand-passwords-and-end-to-end-email-sxsw-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Verge</a> — aims to show how much easier Yahoo’s solution is to convention encryption options. The feature will be optional for users. When activated, it will keep the body of an email encrypted but leave basic details, like the timestamp and subject, unencrypted. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/03/15/yahoo-exec-shows-encrypted-email-at-sxsw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yahoo expects it to be made available</a> before the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The promise of mobile in <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/tag/india/">India is attracting venture capital</a> at a rate never seen before. The latest deal of note involves <a href="http://www.hungama.com/#/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hungama</a>, a media company that provides music, videos and movies on mobile, desktop and beyond, which is on the cusp of raising more than $100 million.</p>
<p>Sources close to the media company told TechCrunch that it is in “advanced” talks with existing investors Intel Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners, which fronted <a href="http://www.vccircle.com/news/technology/2014/07/04/hungama-raises-40m-led-bessemer-venture-partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $40 million raise</a> last summer. <a href="http://www.medianama.com/2012/10/223-intel-capital-invests-in-hungama-digital-40-million-in-10-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel Capital invested an undisclosed sum</a> in the business in 2012.</p>
<p>Hungama was founded in 2005 as a marketing and communications agency that offered services such as interactive gaming, lead promotion and community building for brands. Eying the growth of mobile, it branched out to entertainment in 2009, and today it is arguably India’s most prominent player in that space. (The original, marketing-focused side of the business was <a href="http://www.medianama.com/2012/06/223-jwt-wpp-hungama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold to WPP in 2012</a>.)</p>
<p>The company is long profitable and the funding round closed last year was for growth. It’s the same story this time around, only with loftier targets. TechCrunch understands that this soon-to-be-completed round will be used to grow the company’s footprint on mobile, tapping into <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/03/15/tapping-into-the-growth-of-indias-emerging-mobile-markets/">the vast growth in adoption of smartphones that is expected in India</a>.</p>
<p>More specifically, we understand that Hungama will invest to develop its technology, platforms and increase its content libraries. Sources at the company also revealed that the money could be used to acquire other market players.</p>
<p>The total audience for Hungama’s services hit 48 million users in February. Of that figure, a whopping 43 million consumed content on a mobile device, with 13.8 million paying for some form of content across its platform. Hungama’s services were used by 227 million consumers during its last financial year, with around one-third spending money in some way.</p>
<p>Those numbers are impressive, and Hungama relationship with India’s telecom operators is a key part of its mainstream reach. Not only do those alliances provide a platform to distribute services across the country, but they allow Hungama to offer song downloads unlike other rivals. In a country where the speed of mobile data connections varies wildly and the overwhelming major of consumers are on pre-paid mobile tariffs, that’s a crucial feature. (The demand for off-network media is such that <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2014/12/10/youtube-offline-india-indonesia-philippines/">YouTube recently introduced offline playback in India</a> and two other markets.)</p>

<p>The company’s main competitors in the music streaming space in India include Times India-owned Gaana, Saavn — which <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/01/21/saavn-11-million-mau/">recently hit 11 million monthly users</a> — and Rdio, which <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/01/15/rdio-india/">entered India</a> in January having acquired Dhingana in 2014. There is also <a href="http://www.airtel.in/wynkmusic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operator Airtel’s Wynk service</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike these younger companies, Hungama goes beyond music to offer Netflix-like movies. With India’s music and film scene closely tied together, the company is betting that this synergy and its international catalog — which just <a href="http://www.medianama.com/2015/03/223-hungama-to-offer-disney-and-marvel-movies-on-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added Disney and Marvel</a> — will help it stand apart from the rest. <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/02/09/internet-org-india/">Being included on Facebook’s free Internet.org portal</a>, which just arrived in India, doesn’t hurt too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Noted Psychologist Revealed as Author of Best-Selling ‘Wonder Woman,’” read the astonishing headline. In the summer of 1942, a press release from the New York offices of All-American Comics turned up at newspapers, magazines and radio stations all over the United States. The identity of Wonder Woman’s creator had been “at first kept secret,” it said, but the time had come to make a shocking announcement: “the author of ‘Wonder Woman’ is Dr. William Moulton Marston, internationally famous psychologist.” The truth about Wonder Woman had come out at last.</p>
<p>Or so, at least, it was made to appear. But, really, the name of Wonder Woman’s creator was the least of her secrets.</p>
<p>Wonder Woman is the most popular female comic-book superhero of all time. Aside from Superman and Batman, no other comic-book character has lasted as long. Generations of girls have carried their sandwiches to school in Wonder Woman lunchboxes. Like every other superhero, Wonder Woman has a secret identity. Unlike every other superhero, she also has a secret history.</p>
<p>In one episode, a newspaper editor named Brown, desperate to discover Wonder Woman’s past, assigns a team of reporters to chase her down; she easily escapes them. Brown, gone half mad, is committed to a hospital. Wonder Woman disguises herself as a nurse and brings him a scroll. “This parchment seems to be the history of that girl you call ‘Wonder Woman’!” she tells him. “A strange, veiled woman left it with me.” Brown leaps out of bed and races back to the city desk, where he cries out, parchment in hand, “Stop the presses! I’ve got the history of Wonder Woman!” But Wonder Woman’s secret history isn’t written on parchment. Instead, it lies buried in boxes and cabinets and drawers, in thousands of documents, housed in libraries, archives and collections spread all over the United States, including the private papers of creator Marston—papers that, before I saw them, had never before been seen by anyone outside of Marston’s family.</p>
<p>The veil that has shrouded Wonder Woman’s past for seven decades hides beneath it a crucial story about comic books and superheroes and censorship and feminism. As Marston once put it, “Frankly, Wonder Woman is psychological propaganda for the new type of woman who, I believe, should rule the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of search engines out there to find a cheap flight. Maybe you’ve got a favorite tool like Skyscanner, Hopper, or an online travel agency like Priceline or Expedia. But one option is better than all the rest: <strong>Google Flights.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s right, the search engine behemoth is also king when it comes to finding cheap flights. It’s incredibly powerful, with tons of features that will help you zero in on the best price. And it’s got a bevy of filters you can use to narrow down to the flights you really want … and avoid the ones you don’t. Plus, you can use this tool to search almost all carriers and book directly with an airline rather than through a third party – something that’s <a href="https://thriftytraveler.com/news/travel/coronavirus-lesson-ota/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more important than ever right now</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll show you some of the best tips and tricks to book your next cheap flight at the lowest price. When you’re done, you’ll never use another flight search engine again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="EG5OqA">The FBI announced Friday it was <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-re-open-investigation-clinton-email-server-n674631" target="new" rel="noopener">renewing their investigation</a> into Hillary Clinton&#8217;s use of private email servers, after deciding not to press charges in September after their first round of investigation. For months, the &#8220;email scandal&#8221; has haunted Clinton&#8217;s campaign, and conservatives have used it to feed into a larger message: that Clinton can&#8217;t be trusted.</p>
<p id="lPbFi2">Just look at all the stories Breitbart puts under the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tag/hillary-clinton-email-scandal/">&#8220;</a><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tag/hillary-clinton-email-scandal/">Hillary Clinton Email Scandal</a><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tag/hillary-clinton-email-scandal/">&#8220;</a> tag. It&#8217;s a mishmash of stories — including ones about her hiding health problems, which have nothing to do with email. All the articles together weave a storyline that seems more egregious than the individual parts that make it up.</p>
<p id="bPY0pP">But at the core of it, there really are problems. And we should be able to talk about those problems with clarity. <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/9/13/12770636/hillary-clinton-email-scandals-explained">Vox&#8217;s Jeff Stein created a concise framework</a> about the scandal, so we made a cartoon that pinpoints the primary issues at play.</p>
<h3 id="lWp9mQ">First, let&#8217;s walk through what actually happened</h3>
<p id="Y8YJ3W">To understand what exactly it was that Clinton did, we need to understand what an email server is. It’s the technical underpinning of the controversy.</p>
<p id="iH0WX8">It’s basically like a post office. It&#8217;s a computer connected to the internet that sorts through letters and delivers them.</p>

<p id="aSDAmg">So that means the person in charge of this digital post office — a postmaster, if you will — has an important job. This person has to implement security features to make sure the server can do its job well. This person also has control of the messages coming in and out.</p>
<p id="M3wIMv">Normally for the secretary of state, this responsibility would&#8217;ve belonged to people in federal government who have the expertise to maintain email systems.</p>

<p id="YKSSNI">Clinton&#8217;s private server had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-gregg/six-ways-hillary-clintons_b_8071822.html">several potential points of vulnerability</a>, so it was possible for spies to hack into the system — both to view messages or to reroute messages.</p>
<p id="6dH7VM">There was no evidence that Clinton&#8217;s server was breached, but hackers are good at covering their tracks, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-no-evidence-clintons-email-was-hacked-by-foreign-powers-but-it-could-have-been/2016/07/05/93334ba0-42dc-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html">FBI hints that it thinks </a>a hack was likely.</p>
<p id="R0PZDx">On her servers, an FBI investigation in July 2016 found <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/hillary-r.-clinton/hillary-r.-clinton-part-01-of-02/view">81 email chains</a> that ranged from confidential to top secret, but intelligence agencies overuse these labels, so it&#8217;s unclear if revealing these emails would&#8217;ve actually threatened national security.</p>
<p id="SXmVQO">There was <a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/negligence-and-gross-negligence/">&#8220;</a><a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/negligence-and-gross-negligence/">gross negligence</a><a href="http://www.adamsdrafting.com/negligence-and-gross-negligence/">,&#8221; as the </a><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/07/05/the-clinton-email-probe-and-the-question-of-gross-negligence/" target="new" rel="noopener">FBI points out</a>.</p>
<p id="GIwFhQ">Eventually, Clinton&#8217;s staff hired a private company to run their email servers in Secaucus, New Jersey. This was a more secure option, but still not ideal. In fact, if we&#8217;re talking about pure security, it&#8217;s unclear what the best option would&#8217;ve been.</p>

<p id="YmWBbj">Email servers are physical computers — and the person who controls those servers has your data.</p>
<p id="vU1voW">When Congress was investigating the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, it asked the State Department for Clinton&#8217;s emails. But the department <a href="http://benghazi.house.gov/sites/republicans.benghazi.house.gov/files/Interim%20Progress%20Update%2005-08-15.pdf">only turned over eight emails</a>. That&#8217;s because Clinton&#8217;s emails were on her own server, not theirs.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">That said, Republicans have insisted Clinton did this to avoid having her emails released or subject to the Freedom of Information Act. In other words, the accusation is that she did it so the public couldn’t see her communication. This goes to motive, which means it&#8217;s difficult to prove either way, and anyone who claims otherwise is speculating.</span></div>

<p id="w7JgnW">But the idea that she is actively trying to hide her communication feeds into a more absurd accusation that we should dismiss: that Clinton tried to delete emails from her server during the House&#8217;s Benghazi investigation. Vox&#8217;s Jeff Stein has a good timeline showing why <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/9/13/12770636/hillary-clinton-email-scandals-explained">this theory makes no sense</a>.</p>

<p id="x7rRmc">There is another completely separate case that has to do with emails but gets thrown into the &#8220;Clinton email scandal&#8221; bin as well. The right-wing transparency group Judicial Watch obtained emails between top officials at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p id="65sxMH">Some think it shows that people who donated to the Clinton Foundation received preference from the secretary of state&#8217;s office. There is no evidence to back this up, and this storyline has nothing to do with her private server. It&#8217;s another story, like the one about her health, that is woven into the larger narrative that Clinton can&#8217;t be trusted.</p>
<h3 id="UEhvQX">What we should actually take away from this</h3>
<p id="BKip1S">There are two primary problems with Clinton&#8217;s decision to use a private email server.</p>
<p id="Jaz3Oi">The first is cybersecurity. The FBI concluded that Clinton and her staff were not fully aware of the threat they exposed themselves to. It points to a larger problem with government, where public servants outside the intelligence agencies often treat cybersecurity as an afterthought. Last year, Congress did <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754">pass a law</a> that allows private companies to work with government to improve cybersecurity, and this year President Barack Obama created a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-obama-idUSKCN0VQ2BZ">commission on cyber defense</a>. But there are still massive <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2016/0914/Opinion-How-the-next-president-can-get-cybersecurity-right">political</a> and <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/02/president_obama_s_cybersecurity_plan_is_ambitious_but_flawed.html">bureaucratic</a> problems that the next executive has to deal with.</p>
<p id="02UUU6">The second issue is transparency. The Obama administration has been among the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-least-transparent-administration-1433287361">&#8220;</a><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-least-transparent-administration-1433287361">least transparent</a><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-least-transparent-administration-1433287361">&#8220;</a> in recent history, even though Obama promised greater transparency during his 2008 campaign. The administration has kept entire <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/02/the-obama-administrations-abject-failure-on-transparency/252387/">government programs secret</a>, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-least-transparent-administration-1433287361">stonewalled public records requests</a>, and viciously <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-obamas-war-on-leaks-reporters-fight-back/2013/10/04/70231e1c-2aeb-11e3-b139-029811dbb57f_story.html?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.6d163cdd427e">gone after those who leak information</a>.</p>
<p id="cf8Lut">An Associated Press investigation found that the backlog of public records requests <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/obama-administration-sets-new-record-withholding-foia-requests/">grew 55 percent</a> under Obama. So whatever Clinton&#8217;s motive was for the private server, it brings up concerns about whether the public&#8217;s right to know will continue to erode under the next administration. And Donald Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/donald-trump-taxes/">hasn&#8217;t exactly been the model</a> for transparency either, though he has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/arts/television/on-dr-oz-trump-offers-placebo-transparency.html?_r=0">tried to create the illusion of it</a>.</p>
<p id="2UFjXv">Both of these are massive, nuanced issues that raise real questions about how Clinton or Trump would govern. It touches on two increasingly relevant issues about our data — how we should protect it, and who should be able to see it. But they’ve been reframed into this amorphous narrative about trust.</p>
